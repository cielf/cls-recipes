     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This rice pudding is rice cooked in a lot of milk that reduces to a yummy creamy goodness.  Raisins are optional - some like so many raisins that it should be called raisin pudding, and some prefer to leave the raisins out entirely </p>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li> 1 cup Minute Rice.   Note, you can use regular rice, but you need to add an extra cup of milk</li>
        <li> 5 cups milk</li>
        <li> 1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li> 1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li> 1-1/2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li> 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li> raisins.  I like a cup, but YMMV (optional)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a large saucepan -- you'll probably want your largest pan with a stick handle</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil -- I would do this over high-medium heat.  Watch it carefully, because milk boils over very easily</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat an egg yolk slightly, and add a wee bit of the hot rice mixture to it and mix well.  Mix in the raisins if using</li>
        <li>Return the eggy mixture to the saucepan</li>
        <li>Heat to boiling</li>
        <li>Remove from heat</li>
        <li>Serve warm or chilled.   It is very nice warm with a bit of heavy cream</li>
     </ol>
