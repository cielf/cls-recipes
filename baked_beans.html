    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"CL's home-baked beans" are based on a recipe handed down through at least 3 generations -- but everyone in this generation credits CL.</p>
    <p>Essentially they are beans in a brown-sugar-molasses-ketchupy sauce, with a lot of onions and with bacon throughout.  
    They work very well as a side dish at your festive dinners.</p>
    <p>If your diners include vegans, vegetarians, or people who just don't eat bacon,  you can leave it out, or (my preference) split the recipe in two and omit the bacon from half of it.  More bacon for those who like it!</p>   

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    Note:  there is no measuring involved in CL's baked beans.  

    <ul>
        <li>Dried Navy Beans - 900g package</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>French's -style Mustard -- i.e. the mustard you use on hot dogs, rather than a dijon or old-style mustard</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Molasses - less than half a pint, but I think more than a quarter</li>
        <li>Onion -- at least one large spanish onion.  More if you really really like onions</li>
        <li>Sliced Bacon - 1 '1 pound' package</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans overnight.   Add a little baking soda to the soaking water -- this is said to reduce the flatulence-inducing quality of the beans</li>
        <li>Drain the beans, and then  put them in a large pot with enough water to cover them by at least a couple inches.   </li>
        <li>Bring the pot of beans to boiling, then reduce the heat to a hearty simmer -- you do not want to have these boil over (the smell is awful)</li>
        <li>Simmer the beans for an hour or so.  They're done when it is easy to smush them against the side of the pot</li>
        <li>In the meantime.  Slice the onion -- it doesn't have to be particularly thin.   Also, cut all the bacon except 3 slices into 1/2 -3/4 " pieces.  Set the bacon and the onion aside (the timing of this is not crucial.  It's just a conveneint time to do it)</li>
        <li>Drain the beans, and transfer them to a large casseole dish. </li>
        <li>This is a good time to turn the oven on - 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Squirt 3 or 4 good squirts of ketchup, and about half as much mustard into the beans</li>
        <li>Dump in a fair bit of brown sugar -- maybe 3/4 of a cup to start</li>
        <li>Add about a third of a pint of molasses</li>
        <li>Stir everything up.  The colour of the sauce should be an orangey brown -- lighter and a bit more yellow than in the picture above.  Adjust the ketchup/mustard/molasses so it looks good.  (yes, this should have a picture)</li>
        <li>Add the onions and stir everything up.  </li>
        <li>*If* you are cooking a version with bacon, and one without, put the amount that is going to be baconless into another casserole dish</li>
        <li>Stir in the cut up bacon</li>
        <li>Smooth out the top of the beans, and add the reserved bacon slices to the top</li>
        <li>Cover the casserole dish(es) and put them in the oven.  Turn the oven on to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Bake for about an hour and a half. </li>
        <li> If you want the beans browner than they are,  remove the lids and bake for another half hour</li>
    </ol>

    Note:  If you are taking these to a festive meal, you can at this point wrap them in alternating layers of newspaer and towels, and they will retain their heat for several hours.
